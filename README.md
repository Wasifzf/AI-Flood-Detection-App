# ðŸŒŠ AI Flood Detection App

This project uses deep learning for automated flood detection and segmentation from satellite or aerial imagery. It combines image classification and semantic segmentation to detect whether an image contains a flood and highlights flooded regions in images and videos.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Flood Classification**: Classifies images as `Flood` or `Non-Flood` with a confidence score.
- **Flood Segmentation**: Detects and segments flooded regions in input images and videos using a U-Net-based architecture.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Simple interface to upload and analyze images and videos with a download button.
